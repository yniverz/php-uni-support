# University Module Support System

This repository contains a simple PHP-based application that allows users to manage “modules” (courses) and their associated requirements or tasks. It includes functionality for:
 - User registration, login, and logout
 - Tracking module requirements, credits, and progress
 - Admin panel (for user management)

All data (user accounts and module information) is stored in JSON files statically – no database needed. Thus this application is only recommended for small-scale use or as a learning project.
