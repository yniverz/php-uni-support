<h1>Terms & Cookies</h1>

<h2>1. About This Service</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Term Planner</strong> (<a href="https://study.ats.pm">study.ats.pm</a>) is a private, registration-only web service
    for managing and tracking academic terms. Use of the service is possible only after creating an account and accepting these Terms & Cookies.
</p>
<p>
    This is a non-commercial, private service operated from Germany. It is intended for personal use only.
</p>

<h2>2. Cookies Used</h2>
<p>
    This service uses cookies that are technically necessary for operation and, once you log in, may also use
    Microsoft Clarity for analytics purposes. These cookies are stored in your browser.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Session Cookie (essential):</strong> Used by PHP to maintain your login session (e.g., <code>PHPSESSID</code>).
        Without it, the service will not function. This cookie is deleted when you log out or close your browser.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent Cookie:</strong> Stores your acceptance of these Terms & Cookies so you are not asked again.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Clarity Cookies (non-essential):</strong> Set after login for analytics and usage insights.
        These may include cookies like <code>_clck</code> and <code>_clsk</code> to track session behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Microsoft Clarity Analytics</h2>
<p>
    After logging in, this service uses <a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Clarity</a> to understand how the site is used
    and to improve functionality. Clarity may record anonymized usage patterns such as clicks, scrolling, and navigation.
</p>
<p>
    Data from Clarity is processed according to Microsoft’s privacy statement and may be transferred to servers outside the EU,
    including the United States, under the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not wish Clarity to collect data, you cannot use the service, as it is part of the operational setup.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Collected</h2>
<p>
    The following personal data is processed to provide the service:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Account name (username)</li>
    <li>Hashed password (stored securely using industry-standard hashing)</li>
    <li>Academic term data you enter (e.g., course names, grades, schedules)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This data is not shared with third parties except the usage analytics collected by Microsoft Clarity as described above.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
    Your account data is kept as long as your account exists. You may delete your account at any time through the account settings.
</p>
<p>
    Session cookies are stored until you log out or close your browser. Microsoft Clarity cookies may persist for up to one year unless cleared.

    (necessary for the performance of the contract). The legal basis for analytics cookies (Microsoft Clarity) is your explicit consent
