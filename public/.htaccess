# This file:
#   - Denies direct access to the /app/ folder (returns 404).
#   - Ensures index.php is the default directory index if needed.

# Turn on rewriting engine
RewriteEngine On

# If the request starts with "app/", return a 404 (pretend it doesn't exist)
RewriteRule ^app/ - [R=404,L]

# Optionally ensure we load index.php by default if directory requested
DirectoryIndex index.php
